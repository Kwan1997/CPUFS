# CPUFS
Codes for reproducing our paper *"Unsupervised Feature Selection via Graph Regularized Nonnegative CP Decomposition"*. Specifically, 
- Run the file **"tensorFShandler_guan_penaltyD.m"** for reproducing the results of **CPUFS** on the **ORL** dataset, and 
- Run the file **"tensorFShandler_chen_penaltyD.m"** for reproducing the results of **CPUFSnn** on **the same** dataset.
- 
~~P.S.: Maybe I shall change the file name of CPUFSnn into **"tensorFShandler_li_penaltyD.m"** as this is what Li has formulated...~~

Required packages:
- **MATLAB Tensor Toolbox** (downloadable from [here](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/)),
- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox** (built-in), and
- **Parallel Computing Toolbox** (built-in).
